# Synchronized Music Streaming System using Java

A Java-based Music Streaming System built on a **client-server architecture**, enabling users to stream audio files, handle requests via a dedicated server, and **synchronize playback** across multiple systems connected through the same IPv4 address.

# Features:
- **Client-Server Communication** using Java Sockets
- **Real-Time Music Streaming**
- **Synchronized Playback** between multiple clients on the same network
- Handles **multiple requests** from clients efficiently
- Modular codebase for clear separation of client and server responsibilities
- Works over **local network** using IPv4

# Technologies Used:
- **Java** (Core + Networking)
- **Socket Programming**
- **Multithreading**
- **File I/O**
- **Swing/AWT** 
- **TCP/IP Protocol**
